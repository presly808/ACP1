1. Theoretical material
    Annotations, GIT branching
    patterns Proxy and Decorator
    Reflection API, Java IO, IO Filter
    Modules in IDEA and other settings

2. To finish stated tasks
    2.1. Serialization using reflection
    2.2. Implement Buffered reading from (InputStream, Reader)

3. Write own implementation of Scanner (based on Decorator pattern)
        -String next()
        -int nextInt()
        -String nextLine()
        -boolean hasNext()
        -boolean hasNextInt()
        -useDelemiter(String)
        -close()

4. Write class Timer, that performs some action in defined period of time
    - start(long delay, Action action) // Action is your own interface with one method, for ex. see ActionListener inteface
    - stop()

4. Dynamic sorter
    Sort numbers which are placed in file with defined frequency
    Use class Timer above
