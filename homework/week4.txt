1. Theoretical material for repeating
    Threads synchronization(wait, notify, notifyAll)
    Sockets(ServerSocket, Socket), XML(DOM, SAX), Logging(java.util.logging.*)

    class Properties

2. Implement asynchronous chat that allows communication with two and more users
    Must have
    - logging (saving history of messages and logging all non-standard situations)
    - read connections setting(port, max users size, list of banned users)
        from server_settings.properties (see class Properties)
    - *  read connections setting(port, max users size, list of banned users)
                 from server_settings.xml (use SAX)
    - send message using Serialization
    -* send message in xml file(generate message using DOM)
    - for better architecture of application see pattern Observer
    - don't forget about Swing

This is task for team work )
